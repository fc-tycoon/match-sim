Original Source: The hash function that inspired SplitMix32 is the MurmurHash3 finalizer (fmix32). Chris Wellons used his "hash prospector" tool to find improved constants for better statistical properties.

Note: The original SplitMix64 (64-bit version) was created by Guy Steele and Doug Lea for Java's SplittableRandom. The 32-bit variant with improved constants is Chris Wellons' work, released to public domain.
