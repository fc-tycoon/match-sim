	"name": "Poacher",
	"tooltip": "Pure penalty box predator who lives for goal-scoring opportunities, prioritizing position over build-up.",
	"description": "The Poacher represents the purest expression of striker specialization—a player utterly focused on being in the right place at the right time to score goals. This role eschews involvement in build-up play, creative contribution, and defensive work in favor of relentless goal-scoring instinct and exceptional spatial awareness inside the penalty area. The Poacher's game is defined by ruthless efficiency: minimal touches, maximum impact. Every movement, every decision, every action is calculated to increase scoring probability, whether anticipating rebounds, timing runs to the near post, or simply lurking in dangerous zones waiting for half-chances.\n\nWhat makes the Poacher devastating is their exceptional anticipation and positioning intelligence. They read the game several seconds ahead, constantly adjusting position based on ball trajectory, teammate movements, and defensive gaps. Their runs are perfectly timed—not too early to trigger offsides, not too late to miss the opportunity. They specialize in blindside movements that defenders cannot track, arriving at the crucial moment from unexpected angles. Once in scoring position, they demonstrate clinical finishing, favoring first-time strikes over elaborate preparation and showing willingness to shoot from any viable angle inside the box.\n\nThis role thrives in systems that create high-quality crossing opportunities and generate numerous shots, as the Poacher excels at capitalizing on half-chances that other strikers might not even attempt. Their minimal roaming range keeps them constantly available in advanced positions, stretching defensive lines to maximum depth and creating space for others to exploit. During transitions, they transform into pure counter-attacking threats, sprinting directly toward goal with exceptional directness. The Poacher accepts their narrow role description—they won't win aerial battles like a target man, won't drop deep to link play, won't press defenders relentlessly—but within the penalty box, they're utterly lethal. Think Filippo Inzaghi's uncanny positioning, Gerd Müller's clinical instinct, or Javier Hernández's predatory movement—strikers whose entire purpose is scoring goals, refined to purest essence.",
