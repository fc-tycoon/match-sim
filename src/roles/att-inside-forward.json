	"description": "The Inside Forward is modern football's primary wide goal threat - a winger who drifts infield to shoot rather than cross, inverting onto their stronger foot to create scoring opportunities. With high shot position seeking aggression and exceptional penalty box invasion, this role constantly looks to get into goal-scoring positions from wide starting areas. Exceptional diagonal run frequency and outstanding box entry runs allow cutting inside at angles difficult for defenders to track, while high blind-side movement creates unpredictable attacking threats. Outstanding shooting frequency from all ranges reflects the goal-first mentality, with high first-time shooting creating immediate danger. Excellent dribble direction bias toward cutting inside distinguishes this from traditional wide players who go down the line. Outstanding counter-attack participation and maximum sprint intensity forward make Inside Forwards devastating in transition, arriving quickly to support strikers or finish themselves. Good underlap run frequency allows intelligent movement into central areas, while decent through ball attempts and link-up play involvement maintain creative contribution. Minimal defensive engagement beyond counter-pressing, with focus entirely on attacking output. Works best with overlapping full-backs providing width. Think Mohamed Salah, Arjen Robben, Cristiano Ronaldo (wide left) - goal-scoring wingers who cut inside to shoot.",
