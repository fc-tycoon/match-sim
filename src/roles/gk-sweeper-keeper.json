	"description": "The modern evolution of goalkeeping - a hybrid shot-stopper and ball-playing defender who functions as an auxiliary outfield player. Positioned aggressively high, this keeper provides sweeping coverage behind a high defensive line with exceptional range and frequency, particularly against through balls. Build-up participation is extensive, with strong preference for short distribution to feet and high ball-playing confidence even under pressure. Quick distribution after saves and strong counter-launching instinct make them ideal for initiating attacks. Comfortable dribbling outside the box when needed with ambitious, accurate passing. Shot-stopping fundamentals remain strong - excellent positioning, reflex diving, and dive commitment - but the role demands technical ability with the ball at their feet. Dominant command of area with aggressive cross-claiming and strong vocal organization. Think Manuel Neuer, Ederson, or Alisson - goalkeepers who can read the game, sweep up danger, and play long passes under pressure as comfortably as making reaction saves. Essential for teams playing a high defensive line with possession-based football. Requires exceptional positional awareness and decision-making speed as mistakes this far from goal can be costly.",
