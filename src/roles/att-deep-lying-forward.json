	"tooltip": "Technical forward who drops deep to link play, prioritizing hold-up and combinations over pure goal-scoring.",
	"description": "The Deep-Lying Forward offers a more disciplined and structured alternative to the False 9, operating as a reliable link between midfield and attack through intelligent dropping movements and technical hold-up play. While still positioned nominally as a striker, this role consistently comes short to receive the ball, providing a secure outlet for teammates building from deep. Unlike the False 9's extreme positional freedom and creative risk-taking, the Deep-Lying Forward maintains greater positional discipline, focusing on being available, retaining possession under pressure, and bringing runners into dangerous positions through lay-offs and simple combinations.\n\nThis role excels at creating a stable attacking platform through reliability rather than brilliance. The player's tendency to run to feet rather than into space provides teammates with a consistent target, while their strong ball retention priorities ensure possession is rarely surrendered in transition. Once receiving, they look to quickly involve nearby attackers through one-twos, lay-offs, or simple forward passes, essentially functioning as a technical pivot point around which attacks develop. Their depth variation and vertical roaming allow them to find pockets between opposition lines, but always with the intention of linking play rather than creating chaos through extreme movements.\n\nWhat distinguishes the Deep-Lying Forward from more creative forward roles is their balance between creation and finishing. While they drop deep regularly, they maintain enough goal threat to prevent defenders from simply allowing them space, making well-timed runs into the box and demonstrating patience in shot selection. They contribute through close support frequency and involvement in link-up play, but without the selflessness of a False 9—they still seek shooting opportunities when patterns develop favorably. This role suits systems needing a forward who can hold the ball, involve teammates, and still provide a finishing threat, functioning as both target point and scorer. Think Karim Benzema's intelligent link play, Roberto Firmino's combination work, or Álvaro Morata's technical hold-up contributions—forwards who enhance team play through availability and technical quality while maintaining legitimate goal threat.",
