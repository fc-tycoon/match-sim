	"description": "The classic, traditional goalkeeper focused purely on shot-stopping and defensive reliability. Positioned deep on the goal line, this keeper rarely ventures from the penalty area, with minimal sweeping range and extremely low participation in build-up play. Shot-stopping is the primary focus with high dive commitment and exceptional reflex diving. Distribution is conservative and direct - prefers long kicks from hands over playing short to feet. Under pressure, ball-playing confidence drops significantly, reflecting a keeper who knows their strengths lie in stopping shots, not playing as a deep-lying playmaker. Comfortable claiming crosses and organizing the defense vocally, but leaves the sweeping and ball-playing to more modern interpretations of the position. Think David Seaman, Peter Schmeichel, or Gianluigi Buffon in his early years - commanding the penalty area but not straying far from goal. Best suited to teams with a deep defensive line that doesn't require a goalkeeper to act as an auxiliary defender.",
