	"tooltip": "Balanced full-back providing width and defensive cover in equal measure.",
	"description": "The traditional full-back - a well-rounded defender who balances defensive duties with measured attacking support. Positioned wide to patrol the flank, this player provides width when the team attacks but never forgets their primary defensive responsibility. Defensively solid with good tackling, strong recovery running, and excellent discipline tracking back. Defensive width responsibility is paramount, marking wingers tightly and protecting the flank. On the ball, keeps things simple with safe passing and moderate risk appetite, preferring to recycle possession rather than force creative passes. Will overlap teammates when opportunities arise but timing is measured - early runs when safe, not constant bombing forward. Crossing ability is decent from wide positions, providing service when reaching the byline. Work rate is balanced - active in possession to support attacks, but higher defensively to fulfill primary responsibilities. Think traditional Premier League full-backs like Gary Neville, Lee Dixon, or modern examples like César Azpilicueta when playing conservatively. Not as adventurous as a Wing-Back, not as defensively extreme as a No-Nonsense Full-Back, but a reliable, complete performer who does both phases competently. The safe choice for teams wanting defensive security with moderate attacking contribution from the flanks.",
