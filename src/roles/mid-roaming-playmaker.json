	"description": "The Roaming Playmaker is football's ultimate expression of creative freedom - a midfielder with maximum positional liberty to drift across the entire pitch seeking space and creating chaos in opposition structure. With exceptional roaming ranges both vertically and horizontally, minimal position maintenance discipline, and maximum creativity, this role operates wherever the player's intelligence dictates. Outstanding through ball frequency and high passing risk appetite unlock defenses with penetrating passes, while exceptional dribbling in space and high progressive carrying allow direct progression through opponent lines. The role combines elite ball demand frequency with excellent availability in space, constantly seeking involvement and operating as the team's creative heartbeat. Exceptional link-up play involvement and one-two seeking create intricate combinations, while good trick skill frequency and high flair preference add unpredictability. Moderate defensive contribution focuses on intelligent positioning and counter-pressing rather than rigid defensive duties, with good anticipation but limited tackling frequency and defensive aggression. High third man run frequency and decoy movement create space for others, embodying the playmaker's dual role of creating and facilitating. Requires exceptional technical ability, tactical intelligence, and team structure providing defensive cover. Works best in systems built around the Roaming Playmaker's genius. Think Juan Román Riquelme, Zinedine Zidane - players whose freedom to roam creates magic.",
