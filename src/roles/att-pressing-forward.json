	"tooltip": "High-intensity striker who leads the defensive press while maintaining genuine goal-scoring threat.",
	"description": "The Pressing Forward revolutionizes the striker's role by making defensive work the foundation of attacking threat. This role embodies the modern understanding that pressing is not just defensive necessity but offensive weapon—by aggressively harassing opposition defenders and goalkeepers, the Pressing Forward forces errors, wins possession in dangerous areas, and creates immediate scoring opportunities from turnovers. Their relentless work rate and tactical discipline transform them into the team's first line of defense, setting pressing traps, blocking passing lanes, and disrupting opposition build-up play before attacks can develop momentum.\n\nWhat makes the Pressing Forward devastating is their ability to combine exceptional defensive intensity with legitimate goal-scoring threat. They don't simply chase opponents aimlessly—every press is calculated, angled to force specific outcomes, coordinated with teammates to create numerical advantages and trap situations. Their press urgency and initiation speed mean they close down opponents before comfortable passing options emerge, while their press duration persistence ensures defenders remain under sustained pressure. When pressing triggers turnovers, their anticipation and positioning intelligence allow them to immediately capitalize, transitioning from defender to attacker in an instant. Their counter-pressing reaction is exceptional, immediately hunting the ball when possession is lost to prevent opposition counters.\n\nThis role demands extraordinary physical conditioning and mental discipline. The Pressing Forward must maintain high-intensity running across ninety minutes, repeatedly sprinting to close down defenders, tracking back when bypassed, and still possessing energy reserves for penetrating runs and finishing chances. Their work rate in and out of possession is exceptional, their energy conservation philosophy minimal—they accept fatigue as necessary sacrifice for tactical effectiveness. Yet despite this defensive contribution, they remain genuine goal threats through intelligent movement, clinical finishing, and excellent timing on runs into the box. They thrive in high-pressing systems that value aggressive ball-winning and rapid transitions. Think Roberto Firmino's intelligent pressing, Gabriel Jesus's relentless energy, or Alexis Sánchez's aggressive harrying—strikers who redefine the position's responsibilities, proving that the best form of attack is preventing opposition possession in the first place.",
