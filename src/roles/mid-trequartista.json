	"description": "Italian for 'three-quarters', the Trequartista is football's purest creative artist - a number 10 with maximum positional freedom to drift across the attacking third seeking moments of magic. With near-maximum creativity and outstanding through ball frequency, this role unlocks defenses with vision and flair unconstrained by positional discipline. Exceptional roaming ranges both vertically and horizontally allow the Trequartista to float into space wherever opportunity beckons, with minimal position maintenance discipline reflecting complete tactical liberty. Maximum ball demand frequency and outstanding availability in space ensure constant involvement in attacks, operating as the team's creative heartbeat. Exceptional trick skill frequency and high flair preference add unpredictability and entertainment to the role's creative output. Outstanding link-up play involvement and one-two seeking create intricate combinations, while excellent space creation for others reflects the dual role of creating and facilitating. Moderate goal threat through decent shooting and box entry runs, though creation remains the priority. Minimal defensive contribution - lowest pressing intensity and tackling frequency among attacking midfielders - focuses entirely on attacking expression. Requires a team built around defensive cover for the Trequartista's freedom. Think Rui Costa, Francesco Totti, Juan Román Riquelme - players given license to float and create magic without defensive burdens.",
