	"tooltip": "Defensive midfielder who drops between center-backs to form a back-three in possession.",
	"description": "The Half-Back represents tactical evolution - a defensive midfielder who transforms into a third center-back during build-up phases. With exceptional tendency to drop between center-backs in possession and maximum covering frequency, this role provides numerical superiority in defensive phases while offering passing angles to break pressing traps. Exceptional spatial awareness and anticipation allow intelligent positioning to receive under pressure and recycle possession safely. The Half-Back prioritizes low clearance preference in the defensive third, instead looking to pass out from deep positions with composure. Minimal attacking involvement - very low penalty box invasion and forward runs - keeps focus on defensive structure and ball progression from deep. Outstanding interception ability through positioning rather than aggressive challenges, with exceptional recovery run discipline ensuring defensive transitions are covered. Works best in possession-oriented systems facing high pressing, where the extra body in defense facilitates building from the back. Think Sergio Busquets dropping deep under Guardiola, or Jorginho forming a back three for Italy - players who solve tactical problems through intelligent positioning.",
