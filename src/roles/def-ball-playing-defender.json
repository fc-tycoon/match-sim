	"name": "Ball-Playing Defender",
	"tooltip": "Cultured defender who builds attacks from the back with progressive passing.",
	"description": "A technically gifted center-back who treats the ball as a tool for creating attacks, not just clearing danger. Positioned slightly higher with significantly more roaming freedom and lower position maintenance discipline than a standard CB, allowing them to step into midfield when possession is secure. Ball-playing credentials are exceptional: high demand for the ball, excellent availability under pressure, and crucially, a very low clearance preference - this defender wants to pass, not hoof. Passing profile shows progressive intent with substantial risk appetite, strong forward pass willingness, and notable through ball attempts - substantial creativity for a defender. Comfortable dribbling out of pressure and actively participates in link-up play. Will bait the press and carry the ball forward in transitions. Defensively, this role trades some aggression for intelligence: lower tackle frequency, preferring standing tackles, but excellent interception positioning and anticipation. Prefers zonal coverage with exceptional defensive balance and covering frequency. Spatial awareness is elite, making them excellent at reading passing lanes and positioning. Think Sergio Ramos, Gerard Piqué, Mats Hummels, or John Stones - defenders comfortable receiving in tight spaces, beating a press with a dribble, and launching attacks with progressive passes. Sacrifices some raw defensive intensity for technical quality and build-up contributions. Requires composure on the ball and intelligent decision-making when to engage vs when to pass.",
