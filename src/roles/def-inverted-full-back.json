	"tooltip": "Guardiola's defensive innovation - tucks inside to form a back-three in possession.",
	"description": "Pep Guardiola's tactical masterpiece - a full-back who inverts into central areas during build-up to create numerical superiority and provide defensive security. Unlike the Inverted Wing-Back which focuses on midfield overloads, the Inverted Full-Back primarily forms an auxiliary center-back, tucking inside to create a back-three shape in possession. Inversion frequency is maximum, with pulls wide bias low - this player actively seeks central positions. The tactical purpose is dual: provide extra passing option in build-up by dropping deep centrally, and maintain defensive balance by creating extra central defender. Passing profile shows this intent: exceptional short passing, high tempo control, frequent switching of play from central position, low clearance preference. Ball retention under pressure is prioritized - this player must be comfortable receiving in tight spaces. Defensive positioning is conservative: high defensive compactness loyalty, exceptional defensive balance priority, elite covering teammate frequency. Transition defensive positioning priority is maximum with minimal delay - always positioned to defend quickly. Limited attacking ambition with low overlap frequency, preferring underlaps when moving forward. Spatial awareness and anticipation must be elite to read when to invert, where to position defensively, and how to support build-up. Think João Cancelo under Guardiola, Oleksandr Zinchenko, or John Stones when deployed as inverted full-back. Requires exceptional tactical intelligence, positional discipline, and comfort on the ball under pressure. Not about attacking output but about tactical structure - creating numerical advantages in build-up while maintaining defensive balance.",
