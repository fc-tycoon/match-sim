	"description": "The Box-to-Box Midfielder epitomizes completeness - a central midfielder who influences every phase of play through exceptional work rate and balanced abilities. With maximum vertical roaming range and outstanding workrate in and out of possession, this role covers the entire pitch from defensive box to attacking box. Exceptional late run frequency and high box entry runs create goal-scoring opportunities, while excellent tracking back intensity and recovery run speed ensure defensive duties are fulfilled. The role combines good defensive attributes - strong tackling frequency, solid interception ability, excellent covering support - with meaningful attacking contribution through decent creativity and shooting frequency from all ranges. Balanced passing profile with moderate risk appetite ensures reliable progression without excessive turnover, while good dribbling in space allows carrying the ball forward during transitions. Outstanding counter-attack participation and transition support speed make the Box-to-Box crucial in both offensive and defensive transitions. Good spatial awareness ensures intelligent positioning throughout. Works in various formations, requires exceptional fitness and stamina. Think Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Paul Pogba - complete midfielders whose influence spans the entire pitch.",
