	"name": "Centre Back",
	"tooltip": "Balanced defender who prioritizes defensive positioning and solid fundamentals.",
	"description": "The archetypal center-back - a balanced, dependable defender who excels at fundamental defensive work without extreme specialization. Positioned relatively deep with minimal roaming and strong positional discipline. Defensive fundamentals are excellent: aggressive aerial challenges, consistent ground duel engagement, and excellent coverage of teammates with strong defensive balance priority. Tackling is measured and controlled with good anticipation and interception attempts. On the ball, this defender maintains composure with balanced distribution - prefers short to medium passes with low risk-taking and a neutral clearance vs pass preference that shows neither excessive hoofing nor risky ball-playing. Will pass under pressure quickly but keeps it simple. Spatial awareness is strong, making them reliable in reading defensive situations. Recovery running is disciplined with immediate defensive transition priorities. Work rate splits appropriately - moderate in possession but high defensively. Think Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidić, or Virgil van Dijk in their prime - defenders who do everything well without gimmicks. Not a flashy ball-player like a BPD, not an ultra-aggressive stopper like a No-Nonsense Defender, but a reliable, complete defender who reads the game, wins duels, and keeps things simple. The backbone of any solid defense.",
