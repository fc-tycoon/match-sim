	"tooltip": "Defensive midfielder who makes late attacking runs to arrive in the box as the 'second wave'.",
	"description": "Spanish for 'second steering wheel', the Segundo Volante is a defensively-minded midfielder in a double pivot who makes late attacking runs to exploit space. Unlike a traditional Defensive Midfielder who holds position, this role surges forward to support attacks at opportune moments, particularly exploiting space created when opposition players commit forward. Exceptional late run frequency and high penalty box invasion distinguish this from pure holders, with outstanding box entry runs and blind-side movement creating goal-scoring opportunities. The role maintains solid defensive foundations with good tackling frequency, strong interception ability, and excellent covering support, but combines this with adventurous attacking instincts. High work rate and exceptional counter-attack participation ensure involvement in both phases, with outstanding recovery run speed and discipline allowing aggressive forward movement without compromising defensive security. More adventurous than an Anchor Man, more disciplined than a Box-to-Box Midfielder - the Segundo Volante times runs intelligently rather than constantly pushing forward. Strong shooting frequency from all ranges reflects goal-scoring threat, while good spatial awareness ensures defensive positioning isn't sacrificed. Popularized in South American football, requires excellent stamina and tactical intelligence. Works best in double pivots where a partner provides cover.",
