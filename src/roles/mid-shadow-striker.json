	"tooltip": "Goal-hunting attacking midfielder who makes ghost-like runs behind defenders.",
	"description": "The Shadow Striker is football's ultimate goal-hunting number 10 - an attacking midfielder who prioritizes arriving in the box over creating from deep. With exceptional late run frequency and outstanding box entry runs, this role ghosts into dangerous positions behind defenders' shoulders with timing that's difficult to track. Maximum shot position seeking aggression and penalty box invasion ensure constant presence in goal-scoring areas, with outstanding shooting frequency from all ranges reflecting the goal-first mentality. Exceptional blind-side run frequency and high runs across the defense create unpredictable movement patterns that disorganize defensive lines. High counter-attack participation and sprint intensity make the Shadow Striker devastating in transition, arriving quickly to support strikers. Moderate creative contribution through decent through balls and link-up play, though creation is secondary to scoring. Good progressive dribbling allows carrying the ball into the box, while decent one-two seeking facilitates quick combinations in tight spaces. Minimal defensive engagement beyond counter-pressing, with focus entirely on attacking output. More striker than playmaker - operates in the gap between traditional number 10s and strikers. Think Thomas Müller, Dele Alli (prime), Paulo Dybala - players whose movement and finishing from deep positions create goals.",
