	"name": "Second Striker",
	"tooltip": "Support striker who combines playmaking with goal threat, operating between midfield and attack.",
	"description": "The Second Striker represents the classic 'number 10' positioned in the striker zone, embodying the perfect fusion of creator and finisher. Operating just behind the main forward, this role thrives in the dangerous space between opposition midfield and defensive lines, constantly seeking pockets to receive and turn while maintaining a genuine goal threat. Where traditional strikers focus primarily on finishing, the Second Striker balances creative contribution with attacking menace, dropping deep to collect the ball before surging forward with late runs into the penalty area.\n\nThis role excels at linking midfield to attack through intelligent movement and technical quality. The player constantly shows for the ball, demanding possession both in tight areas and space, before combining quickly with teammates through one-twos, lay-offs, and incisive through balls. Their vertical roaming range allows them to drop into midfield pockets when needed, yet they possess the timing and anticipation to arrive late in the box when opportunities arise. This dynamic positioning forces defenders into difficult decisions—follow them deep and create space for the main striker, or hold position and allow them time and space to orchestrate attacks.\n\nThe Second Striker's versatility makes them invaluable in modern formations, particularly in systems utilizing two forwards or a lone striker who needs creative support. They contribute across multiple phases—creating chances through vision and passing, carrying the ball progressively through dribbles, and finishing moves they've helped construct. Their blend of close support frequency, creative risk-taking, and genuine shooting threat from various ranges makes them unpredictable and difficult to neutralize. Think Roberto Baggio's intelligent movement, Francesco Totti's creative vision, or Thomas Müller's uncanny ability to arrive in scoring positions—players who redefine the striker role through their dual threat as both creator and finisher.",
