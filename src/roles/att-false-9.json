	"name": "False 9",
	"tooltip": "Revolutionary striker who drops deep to create, prioritizing space creation and playmaking over finishing.",
	"description": "The False 9 revolutionized modern football by redefining the striker's purpose—not as a static focal point for attack, but as a fluid orchestrator who drops deep to create chaos in opposition defensive structures. This role exploits a fundamental dilemma: when the striker abandons traditional positioning to collect the ball in midfield zones, center-backs must choose between following them out of position (creating dangerous space behind) or holding their line (allowing time and space for a technically gifted player to dictate play). The False 9 thrives on this confusion, combining exceptional positional freedom with world-class creativity to manufacture chances for attacking teammates.\n\nUnlike traditional strikers who wait for service in advanced positions, the False 9 demands constant involvement, dropping into midfield to receive the ball and immediately seeking progressive options. Their exceptional spatial awareness allows them to identify pockets between the lines, while their technical quality ensures they can receive under pressure, turn, and execute incisive passes. The role's defining characteristic is extreme depth variation—constantly adjusting vertical positioning to drag defenders out of shape, create passing lanes for teammates, and manufacture numerical superiority in midfield areas. When possession is won, they transform into a creative hub, looking to play through balls, switch play, or combine quickly with advancing midfielders and wide forwards.\n\nThis role requires exceptional intelligence, technique, and selflessness. The False 9 must accept fewer shooting opportunities than traditional strikers, prioritizing team creation over personal glory. Their movement creates space for inside forwards, attacking midfielders, and overlapping fullbacks to exploit, essentially sacrificing their own goal-scoring output to multiply team threat. They excel in possession-dominant systems that value positional fluidity and collective creativity. Think Lionel Messi at Barcelona under Guardiola, Roberto Firmino at Liverpool, or João Félix in free-flowing systems—players who redefine 'striker' as chief creator rather than chief finisher, whose brilliance is measured not just in goals but in the space and opportunities they manufacture for others.",
