	"name": "Wing-Back",
	"tooltip": "Attacking full-back who provides constant width and overlapping runs.",
	"description": "The attacking full-back - a high-energy wide player who treats the entire flank as their territory. Positioned high and wide with significant freedom to roam vertically, the Wing-Back is an attacking outlet first, defender second. Constantly overlapping teammates, making runs behind the defense, and delivering crosses from wide positions. The crossing frequency is exceptional, particularly from wide areas, with variety in delivery - early crosses, back post, pullbacks. Work rate is immense in both phases, requiring elite fitness to sprint up and down the touchline repeatedly. Offensively aggressive with progressive dribbling, high tempo movement with the ball, and strong counter-attack participation. Will invade the penalty box frequently, making runs to both posts and seeking shooting opportunities. Defensively, the challenge is recovery - when caught high up the pitch, recovery run speed must be elite to regain position. Defensive width responsibility remains high, but defensive compactness loyalty is lower, reflecting the positional risk taken by pushing forward. Tracking back intensity is extreme to compensate for advanced positioning. Think Marcelo, Jordi Alba, or modern attacking full-backs in systems with defensive midfield cover. Requires teammates to provide defensive balance - typically paired with a conservative winger or inverted full-back on the opposite flank. High risk, high reward - devastating going forward but demanding defensive transition discipline. Best in back-three systems or with defensive midfield protection.",
