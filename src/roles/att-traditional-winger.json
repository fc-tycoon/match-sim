	"tooltip": "Touchline-hugging wide player who provides natural width and crosses from the byline.",
	"description": "The Traditional Winger is old-school wing play personified - a wide player who stays high and wide to stretch defenses horizontally with pace and dribbling down the touchline. With maximum horizontal width and high channel discipline, this role hugs the sideline to create space for central players and provide crossing opportunities from advanced positions. Exceptional cross frequency from wide areas and high early cross preference make this the primary service provider for strikers, with good far post deliveries creating aerial chances. Outstanding dribble frequency and progressive dribbling willingness allow beating full-backs on the outside, while high ball carry distance enables running at defenders with pace. Excellent counter-attack participation and sprint intensity make the Traditional Winger devastating in transition, stretching play vertically and horizontally. Good space creation for others through width maintenance allows central players room to operate. Moderate goal threat through decent penalty box invasion and shooting frequency, though creation is the primary focus. Minimal defensive contribution beyond tracking the opposing full-back, with limited tracking back intensity. Works best with overlapping full-backs and target men who can attack crosses. Think classic wingers - Ryan Giggs, David Beckham (wide right), Luis Figo - touchline terrorists who deliver crosses.",
