	"name": "No-Nonsense Full-Back",
	"tooltip": "Traditional defensive full-back who prioritizes stopping attacks over supporting them.",
	"description": "The defensive specialist full-back - a player whose philosophy is simple: defend the flank, stop crosses, win duels, don't get caught forward. Positioned wide with extreme channel discipline and pulls wide bias, this player patrols their touchline territory with singular defensive focus. Defensive compactness loyalty is exceptional, staying tight to the defensive line rather than pushing forward. Clearance preference is high - when in doubt, put the ball into touch or up the field. Minimal attacking ambition with low overlap frequency, conservative forward runs, and limited box invasion. Ball retention under pressure is prioritized over progressive play - this player won't lose the ball in dangerous areas. Defensively, the metrics are extreme: high tackle frequency, strong defensive aggression, excellent tracking runner priority, and maximum tracking distance willingness. Recovery run discipline is elite with minimal defensive transition delay - always the first back when defending. Pressing is aggressive across all intensities, engaging attackers early and persistently. Aerial duels and ground duels are attacked with equal commitment. Work rate heavily skewed defensively with lower in-possession activity - saves energy for defensive work. Think traditional English full-backs like Gary Neville in defensive mode, or specialists brought on to protect leads. The polar opposite of attacking wing-backs - sacrifices all offensive contribution for maximum defensive security. Best suited to teams defending leads, playing on the counter, or simply needing a reliable defensive presence. Won't create many goals but won't concede many either.",
