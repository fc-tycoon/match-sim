	"tooltip": "Balanced defensive midfielder who protects the defense while supporting attacks.",
	"description": "The Defensive Midfielder represents tactical versatility - a balanced midfield anchor who combines defensive solidity with meaningful attacking contribution. Unlike specialized roles like the Anchor Man or Ball-Winning Midfielder, this role offers equilibrium across all phases of play. Good defensive attributes with strong tackling frequency, interception ability, and covering support ensure protection for the back line, while moderate creativity and passing risk appetite allow progressive ball progression. Balanced roaming ranges provide coverage without abandoning position, with good work rate ensuring presence in both defensive and attacking transitions. The role handles pressing duties competently across all zones, combining decent press urgency with solid counter-press intensity. Moderate attacking involvement includes late runs into the box and willingness to shoot from distance, while maintaining defensive responsibilities through excellent recovery run discipline. Good spatial awareness and decision consistency make this a reliable option in various tactical systems. Works in single or double pivot configurations, adapting to team needs. Think a blend of different defensive midfield archetypes - the all-around midfield protector who does everything competently without extreme specialization.",
