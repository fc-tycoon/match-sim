	"description": "The Attacking Midfielder represents attacking versatility - a number 10 who balances creative responsibilities with meaningful goal-scoring threat. Unlike the Advanced Playmaker who prioritizes creation or the Shadow Striker who hunts goals, this role offers equilibrium between assisting and scoring. High creativity and good through ball frequency unlock defenses with penetrating passes, while strong shot position seeking and high penalty box invasion create personal scoring opportunities. Excellent box entry runs and high shooting frequency from all ranges ensure constant goal threat, with good late run timing bringing the player into dangerous positions. Outstanding link-up play involvement and one-two seeking facilitate combination play, while decent space creation for others balances personal and team attacking contribution. Good progressive dribble willingness allows carrying the ball forward, while decent crossing from half-spaces provides an additional creative outlet. Moderate defensive contribution through counter-pressing and good recovery runs, though physical engagement remains limited. Works in various tactical systems requiring a complete attacking midfielder. Think Bruno Fernandes, James Maddison - modern number 10s who both create and score prolifically.",
