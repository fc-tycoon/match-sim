	"tooltip": "Creative winger who cuts inside to create and pass more than shoot from wide areas.",
	"description": "The Inverted Winger blends the positional flexibility of an Inside Forward with the creative mentality of a playmaker - a wide player who cuts inside to create as much as to score. With high creativity and good through ball frequency, this role unlocks defenses with penetrating passes from wide-to-central positions rather than pure goal-hunting. High dribble direction bias toward cutting inside creates opportunities in half-spaces, while good cross frequency from half-space positions provides an alternative creative outlet to pure shooting. Outstanding link-up play involvement and one-two seeking create intricate combinations when moving inside, while high space creation for others ensures teammates benefit from the Inverted Winger's movement. Good diagonal runs and underlap movement create passing angles and central overloads, with decent box entry runs maintaining goal threat without dominating the role. Excellent counter-attack participation and good ball-carrying combine creativity with transition threat. Good trick skill frequency and creative risk-taking add unpredictability to attacking play. Moderate defensive contribution through decent tracking back and counter-pressing. Works best with overlapping full-backs and intelligent central runners. Think Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez, Eden Hazard - creative wingers who cut inside to create and score.",
