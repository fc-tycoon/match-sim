	"name": "Libero",
	"tooltip": "Free-roaming sweeper who plays behind the defense and dictates play from deep.",
	"description": "The Libero - Italian for 'free' - is football's most elegant defensive role, a sweeper who combines last-line defensive coverage with the creative freedom to orchestrate attacks from deep. Playing behind the main defensive line, the Libero roams extensively across the pitch with exceptional positional freedom, dropping deep to sweep up danger before surging forward to initiate attacks. This is the most complete defender - equally comfortable making last-ditch tackles, playing defense-splitting passes, or carrying the ball into midfield. Defensively, the Libero excels through positioning and anticipation rather than aggression, reading the game to intercept danger and provide covering support for teammates. The sweeping role demands exceptional spatial awareness to read passing lanes and dangerous runs. In possession, this defender transforms into a deep-lying playmaker with ambitious passing, comfortable dribbling out from the back, and the vision to switch play or thread through balls. The Libero frequently steps into midfield when possession allows, acting as an auxiliary midfielder who dictates tempo from deep. This role requires complete trust from teammates - the freedom to roam means others must cover positionally. Think Franz Beckenbauer, the role's greatest exponent, or players like Matthias Sammer, Franco Baresi, or Ronald Koeman. The Libero is football's renaissance defender - defending when needed, creating when possible, always reading the game two steps ahead. A dying art in modern football, but devastating in the right tactical system with the right player.",
