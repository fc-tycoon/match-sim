	"tooltip": "Deep-lying playmaker with complete freedom to roam and orchestrate across the pitch.",
	"description": "The Regista is Andrea Pirlo's signature role - a quarterback who dictates tempo from deep with exceptional passing range and complete positional freedom. Unlike the Deep-Lying Playmaker who maintains positional discipline, the Regista has license to drift across the pitch seeking space and angles, with maximum creativity and exceptional roaming ranges both vertically and horizontally. Elite tempo control and switch play frequency allow complete domination of the game's rhythm, while outstanding through ball attempts and passing risk appetite unlock defensive lines with penetrating passes. The role combines exceptional ball demand frequency with high availability under pressure, constantly orchestrating play from deep positions. Minimal position maintenance discipline reflects the freedom to roam, with good dribbling ability in space allowing progression through carrying as well as passing. Moderate defensive contribution focuses on intelligent positioning rather than physical engagement, with decent interception frequency but limited pressing intensity and tackling aggression. Higher attacking involvement than traditional holders includes willingness to make forward runs and edge of box positioning for long-range shots. Requires exceptional technical ability, tactical intelligence, and a team structure providing defensive cover. Works best in possession-dominant systems built around the Regista's creative genius.",
