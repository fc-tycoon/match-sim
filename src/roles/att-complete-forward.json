	"name": "Complete Forward",
	"tooltip": "Elite all-around striker with no weaknesses, capable of scoring, creating, and contributing across all phases.",
	"description": "The Complete Forward represents the pinnacle of striker evolution—a player who combines every positive attribute of specialist roles into one comprehensive package. Where other forwards excel in specific areas while accepting limitations elsewhere, the Complete Forward demonstrates excellence across the entire spectrum of attacking play. They can finish like a Poacher, hold up play like a Target Man, create like a False 9, press like a Pressing Forward, and stretch defenses like an Advanced Forward. This versatility doesn't mean they're merely adequate at everything; rather, they perform each function at elite level, adapting their approach based on game situations, opposition weaknesses, and team needs.\n\nWhat defines the Complete Forward is their balanced excellence across all tendency categories. Their shooting frequency and accuracy from multiple ranges makes them dangerous from anywhere in the final third. Their link-up play involvement and creativity allow them to drop deep and orchestrate attacks when needed. Their aerial ability and physical duel intensity mean they can compete for contested balls and win headers. Their work rate and pressing contribution ensure they contribute defensively. Their dribbling ability and progressive carries allow them to beat defenders individually. Their spatial awareness and movement intelligence create constant problems for defensive organizations through varied runs—early, late, diagonal, blindside—all executed with perfect timing.\n\nThis role thrives in any system because it adapts to tactical requirements seamlessly. Against high defensive lines, they exploit space in behind. Against deep blocks, they drop into pockets and create through combination play. Against aggressive pressing, they hold up possession and bring teammates into play. In transition, they counter with devastating directness. The Complete Forward's versatility extends to their selflessness—while possessing exceptional individual quality, they understand when to create for others versus when to be selfish and shoot. They read games exceptionally well, adjusting their positioning, movement, and decision-making to exploit whatever weaknesses opposition defenses present. Think Cristiano Ronaldo's complete skill set, Karim Benzema's tactical intelligence and versatility, or Harry Kane's all-around excellence—strikers who can dominate matches through multiple methods, providing managers with the ultimate tactical weapon: a forward who genuinely has no weaknesses and can deliver whatever the situation demands.",
