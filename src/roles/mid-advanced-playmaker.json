	"description": "The Advanced Playmaker is football's conductor in the final third - an attacking midfielder who operates between the lines with exceptional vision and passing range to unlock defenses. With maximum creativity and outstanding through ball frequency, this role specializes in threading penetrating passes that split defensive lines and create goal-scoring opportunities. Exceptional ball demand frequency reflects constant involvement, with outstanding availability in space ensuring the playmaker always offers an outlet. Elite tempo control allows dictating the game's rhythm in advanced areas, while good positional freedom permits intelligent movement to find pockets of space. Outstanding link-up play involvement and one-two seeking create intricate combinations with teammates, while excellent space creation for others reflects the playmaker's dual role of creating and facilitating. Moderate goal threat through decent shooting frequency from all ranges, though creation takes priority over finishing. Good dribbling ability in space allows carrying the ball into dangerous areas when passing lanes are closed. Minimal defensive contribution focuses on intelligent positioning and counter-pressing rather than physical engagement. Works best in possession-dominant systems with intelligent runners making use of creative passes. Think Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Mesut Özil - orchestrators whose vision creates chances from nothing.",
