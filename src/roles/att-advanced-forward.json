	"tooltip": "Pace-driven striker who constantly threatens space in behind, stretching defenses with relentless forward runs.",
	"description": "The Advanced Forward weaponizes pace and movement to stretch defensive lines to breaking point, constantly threatening the space behind opposition defenders with relentless runs in behind. This role transforms speed into tactical advantage—by maintaining advanced positioning and repeatedly making penetrating runs, they force defenders into uncomfortable choices: drop deep to cover space (allowing midfield overloads), or hold their line (risking exposure to through balls and long passes). The Advanced Forward's game is built on the principle that threatening space is as valuable as threatening possession, creating constant anxiety in defensive organizations through sheer pace and intelligent off-ball movement.\n\nWhat makes the Advanced Forward devastating is their exceptional run anticipation and timing. They don't simply sprint aimlessly forward—every run is calculated to exploit defensive gaps, timed to perfection to arrive on the shoulder of the last defender precisely as the ball is played. Their early run frequency and run behind defense tendencies mean they're constantly testing defensive depth, forcing center-backs to communicate, track, and recover at exhausting frequency. Their diagonal runs and blindside movements make them nearly impossible to mark consistently, as they appear from unexpected angles and positions that defenders struggle to monitor while watching the ball.\n\nDuring transitions, the Advanced Forward becomes particularly lethal. Their counter-attack sprint intensity and participation are maximum—the moment possession is won, they accelerate toward goal with devastating directness, often arriving in scoring positions before defensive organization can recover. Their progressive dribble willingness means they can carry the ball at pace when space opens, while their shooting frequency and close-range finishing ensure they capitalize efficiently when chances arrive. They thrive in systems that value quick transitions, direct passing, and exploiting high defensive lines. Unlike hold-up forwards who wait for service, the Advanced Forward creates their own opportunities through relentless running and pace. Think Kylian Mbappé's explosive speed, Thierry Henry's intelligent movement in behind, or Fernando Torres in his prime—strikers who terrorize defenses not through technical brilliance or physical dominance, but through pure pace, perfect timing, and the constant threat of the ball over the top.",
