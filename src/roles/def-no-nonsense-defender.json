	"tooltip": "Old-school stopper who clears danger first and asks questions later.",
	"description": "The ultimate safety-first defender - a physically imposing, uncompromising center-back who believes defending means clearing danger, not playing possession football. Positioned deep with absolutely minimal roaming and extreme positional discipline, this defender stays exactly where they're supposed to be. The defining characteristic is the clearance preference - when in doubt, the ball goes into Row Z. Ball-playing is minimal by design: very low availability under pressure, almost never dribbles, and near-zero risk appetite. When forced to pass, prefers it backwards or long, executing quickly under pressure with first-time clearances. Defensive work is aggressive and uncompromising: high tackle frequency with strong defensive aggression, exceptional aerial dominance, and intense physical duel engagement. Ground duels are attacked with equal vigor. Positional discipline extends to defensive structure - extremely loyal to defensive compactness, excellent covering of teammates, and outstanding recovery run discipline with minimal defensive transition delay. Work rate heavily skewed defensive. Spatial awareness is solid, focused purely on defensive positioning, not creative movement. Think Tony Adams, Jaap Stam, Nemanja Vidić, or classic English center-backs who dominated through physicality, aggression, and no-nonsense defending. The polar opposite of a Ball-Playing Defender - sacrifices all technical sophistication for maximum defensive security. Best suited to teams that don't require build-up play from defenders and value defensive reliability above possession retention. When danger appears, this defender's solution is simple: clear it, hard and far.",
