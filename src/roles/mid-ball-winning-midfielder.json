	"description": "The Ball-Winning Midfielder is football's ultimate disruptor - a defensive midfielder who hunts the ball with relentless energy and physicality. With exceptional pressing intensity across all zones and maximum tackle attempt frequency, this role thrives on breaking up opposition attacks through aggressive defensive actions. Outstanding counter-press intensity and reaction ensure immediate pressure after losing possession, while exceptional second ball anticipation puts the player first to loose balls. High roaming ranges both vertically and horizontally allow coverage of large areas, though this comes at the cost of positional discipline compared to an Anchor Man. Excellent work rate out of possession and high sprint frequency backward ensure recovery runs are made at pace. The role combines strong man-marking tendencies with aggressive ground and aerial duel engagement, making it effective against physical opposition. After winning possession, distribution is kept simple with moderate passing risk appetite. Significantly more attacking involvement than pure holders, with late runs into the box and willingness to support counters. Think N'Golo Kanté, Casemiro, or Gennaro Gattuso - tireless ball-winners who dominate through sheer work rate and defensive aggression.",
