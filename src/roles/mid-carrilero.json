	"tooltip": "Shuttling midfielder who covers lateral space with tireless defensive support.",
	"description": "The Carrilero is Spanish for 'lane runner' - a shuttling central midfielder who covers enormous lateral ground to provide defensive width and link play across the pitch. With exceptional horizontal roaming range and high horizontal width positioning, this role tirelessly tracks into wide areas to support full-backs and cover spaces. Outstanding work rate and excellent tracking back intensity ensure constant defensive presence, with high defensive width responsibility and tracking runner priority making this crucial against opposition wide threats. The role prioritizes defensive solidity with strong covering frequency, good tackling and interception ability, and excellent recovery run speed and discipline. Attacking contribution remains modest - lower creativity and shooting frequency compared to Box-to-Box or Mezzala roles - with focus on simple, safe distribution to maintain possession. Good lateral dribble willingness allows shuttling with the ball, while decent link-up play involvement ensures connectivity in build-up phases. Works best in three-man midfields where the Carrilero provides balance alongside more creative partners, offering defensive security without extreme attacking ambition. Think Marcos Llorente (in defensive mode), Blaise Matuidi - tireless workers whose lateral coverage allows attacking teammates freedom.",
