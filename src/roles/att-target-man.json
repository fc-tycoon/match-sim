	"name": "Target Man",
	"tooltip": "Physical striker who dominates aerially and holds up play, serving as the focal point for direct attacks.",
	"description": "The Target Man transforms aerial superiority and physical presence into a devastating attacking weapon, serving as the primary focal point for direct play and providing teammates with a reliable outlet for long passes, crosses, and clearances. This role is built around exceptional physical attributes—height, strength, and aerial ability—combined with intelligent positioning to win contested balls and bring others into play. Unlike technically-focused forwards who drop deep to receive on the ground, the Target Man holds advanced positions, constantly offering themselves as a target for direct passes and crosses, ready to contest every aerial duel and transform hopeful balls into attacking opportunities.\n\nWhat defines the Target Man is their exceptional hold-up play and selfless contribution to team attacks. When receiving the ball—typically under intense pressure from defenders—they use their physical strength and body positioning to shield possession, buying time for teammates to advance into supporting positions. Their lay-off preference and link-up play involvement mean they're constantly looking to bring runners into dangerous areas through flick-ons, headed passes, or simple lay-offs. They excel at creating second-ball situations, winning initial aerial contests even when unable to control the ball cleanly, allowing teammates to capitalize on knockdowns and rebounds.\n\nThe Target Man's aerial dominance extends across all phases. During open play, they attack crosses with aggression and precision, using their height and timing to win headers in crowded penalty areas. On set pieces, they become primary threats, combining excellent positioning with aerial duel aggression to generate scoring chances. Their physical presence affects defensive organization even when not touching the ball—center-backs must account for their aerial threat, creating space for other attackers to exploit. While not blessed with pace or dribbling ability, the Target Man compensates through reliability, physical dominance, and tactical intelligence. Think Didier Drogba's powerful hold-up play, Peter Crouch's aerial mastery, or Diego Costa's physical intimidation—strikers who impose themselves physically to create opportunities for themselves and teammates, turning direct play into a legitimate tactical weapon.",
