	"description": "The Deep-Lying Playmaker is football's conductor - a midfielder who controls the game's rhythm from a withdrawn position through exceptional passing range and vision. With outstanding creativity and through ball frequency, this role threads passes that unlock defensive lines while maintaining positional discipline. Exceptional tempo control and switch play frequency allow dictating the game's speed and exploiting space across the pitch. High ball demand frequency reflects confidence in possession, with excellent availability to receive under pressure providing the foundation for building attacks. Unlike the roaming Regista, the Deep-Lying Playmaker maintains good positional discipline, rarely abandoning central areas. Moderate defensive contribution through decent interception frequency and covering support, though physical duels and pressing intensity remain modest. The role excels at dropping deep to collect the ball and progress play through passing rather than dribbling, with high first-time pass preference keeping attacks fluid. Works best in possession-dominant systems where defensive duties can be shared. Think Xabi Alonso, Andrea Pirlo (in disciplined mode), or Toni Kroos - orchestrators who control matches through passing brilliance and game intelligence.",
