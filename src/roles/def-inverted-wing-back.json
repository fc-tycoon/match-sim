	"description": "A tactical innovation designed to create numerical superiority in central areas - the Inverted Wing-Back abandons traditional wide positioning to tuck inside and form midfield overloads. Starting wide but with extreme inversion frequency, this player drifts centrally in possession to create box midfield shapes or provide additional passing options between the lines. The key tactical purpose is positional - by inverting, they allow wingers or attacking midfielders to hold width while creating central control. Underlap runs far exceed overlap runs, moving inside teammates rather than outside them. Diagonal runs and blind-side movements exploit the space created by drifting centrally. Counter-pressing is a major strength - positioned centrally allows quick reaction to turnovers and aggressive pressing in central lanes. Defensive balance priority and covering teammate frequency are exceptional, reflecting the role's tactical discipline. Spatial awareness must be elite to read when to invert vs when to hold width. Passing is sharp and progressive with good through ball attempts, switch play frequency, and link-up involvement. Less crossing than traditional wing-backs, more short passing and combination play. Think of Pep Guardiola's tactical innovation with Cancelo, Zinchenko, or the role in modern systems creating 3-2-5 shapes in possession. Not about individual brilliance but tactical intelligence - knowing when to tuck in, when to provide width, how to support counter-pressing structures. Requires elite spatial awareness and tactical understanding.",
