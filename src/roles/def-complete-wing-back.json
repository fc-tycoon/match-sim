	"tooltip": "Elite attacking wing-back with defensive solidity and creative threat.",
	"description": "The complete modern full-back - a player who excels in both attacking and defensive phases with elite all-around ability. This is the Wing-Back taken to its highest level, combining exceptional attacking output with defensive reliability that other attacking full-backs lack. Positioned extremely wide with maximum roaming range, constantly pushing forward but never abandoning defensive responsibility. Attacking metrics are elite across the board: very high overlap frequency, exceptional crossing from wide areas, strong dribbling ability, progressive carries, and genuine goal threat with decent shooting frequency. Will invade the penalty box, make runs to both posts, attempt through balls, and participate aggressively in counter-attacks. Creative risk-taking and creativity values show this isn't just a runner but a genuine attacking threat. Defensively, maintains strong fundamentals: good tackle frequency, excellent tracking back intensity, elite recovery run speed, and strong counter-pressing. Defensive balance and covering frequency remain high despite attacking freedom. Work rate is exceptional in both phases - this role demands elite fitness and game intelligence. The key difference from a standard Wing-Back is completeness - maintains defensive solidity while providing elite attacking output. Think prime Dani Alves, Trent Alexander-Arnold, or Achraf Hakimi - players who can assist and score goals while fulfilling defensive duties. Requires exceptional physical conditioning, tactical intelligence, and technical ability. The complete package but demanding on the player - not every full-back has the attributes to play this role effectively.",
