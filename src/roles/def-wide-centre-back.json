	"name": "Wide Centre-Back",
	"tooltip": "Center-back in a back-three who provides width and covers wider channels.",
	"description": "A modern tactical innovation - a center-back deployed in a back-three system who operates significantly wider than traditional CBs, providing defensive coverage in wider channels while maintaining central defensive foundations. The defining characteristic is positional width combined with substantial roaming range and moderate positional freedom. This is NOT a full-back; it's a CB adapting to cover wide areas. Defensive positioning shows this hybrid nature: high defensive width responsibility, strong tracking distance limits - willing to follow runners wide, and excellent tracking runner priority with balanced zonal vs man-marking. Maintains CB fundamentals: strong aerial presence, good ground duels, and excellent covering of teammates. The attacking profile reveals the modern adaptability: comfortable carrying the ball laterally, capable of crossing from wide positions and half-spaces, and willing to make overlapping runs - something a traditional CB would never do. Can participate in build-up with decent passing and moderate stepping into midfield. Higher work rate in possession than standard CBs to support wide areas. Pressing is more aggressive than traditional CBs, reflecting the need to engage in wider areas. Channel discipline and pulls wide bias confirm the role's lateral focus. Think of the wide CBs in a Conte back-three or similar systems - defenders like César Azpilicueta, Kyle Walker when played as a wide CB, or Alessandro Bastoni. They maintain defensive solidity while providing width that allows wing-backs to push higher. More adventurous and mobile than a traditional CB, but less attacking than a full-back. The tactical glue in modern three-at-the-back formations.",
