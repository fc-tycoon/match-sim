	"tooltip": "Creative central midfielder who drifts into half-spaces with underlapping runs.",
	"description": "The Mezzala is Italian football's answer to positional fluidity - a central midfielder who operates in the half-spaces between lines with exceptional freedom of movement. With outstanding horizontal roaming range and high positional freedom, this role drifts wide and makes intelligent runs into channels, creating numerical overloads and exploiting space between opposition defensive and midfield lines. Exceptional underlap run frequency distinguishes this from traditional central midfielders, with high diagonal runs and blind-side movement creating unpredictable attacking threats. Outstanding creativity and good through ball frequency unlock defenses with penetrating passes, while excellent progressive dribble willingness allows carrying the ball into dangerous areas. The role combines technical quality with intelligent off-ball movement - high link-up play involvement and one-two seeking create combinations, while good late run frequency ensures presence in attacking situations. Moderate defensive contribution focuses on counter-pressing rather than rigid positioning, with decent recovery speed but lower defensive compactness loyalty reflecting the attacking freedom. Works best in systems with a holding midfielder providing cover, particularly effective in three-man midfields. Think Sergej Milinković-Savić, Nicolo Barella - creative midfielders whose movement disrupts opposition organization.",
