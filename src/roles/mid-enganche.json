	"tooltip": "Static playmaker who occupies a fixed position and demands play flows through them.",
	"description": "Spanish for 'hook' or 'hitch', the Enganche is a static playmaker who serves as the team's attacking focal point - similar to the Trequartista but preferring positional discipline over roaming freedom. With near-maximum creativity and outstanding through ball frequency, this role orchestrates attacks from a fixed position between the lines, acting as the pivot through which all attacking play flows. Exceptional position maintenance discipline and minimal roaming ranges distinguish this from the wandering Trequartista - the Enganche stays put and expects teammates to find them. Maximum ball demand frequency and outstanding availability reflect the role's gravitational pull on attacks, with elite tempo control allowing complete dictation of the attacking rhythm. Outstanding link-up play involvement and one-two seeking create intricate passing combinations from a central position, while exceptional first-time passing keeps attacks fluid. Outstanding space creation for others reflects the Enganche's role as facilitator, using vision and passing rather than movement to create opportunities. Exceptional ball retention under pressure and high composure ensure possession is rarely lost when the ball reaches the Enganche. Minimal defensive contribution and movement - lowest vertical roaming among all roles - conserves energy for creative moments. Requires intelligent runners around them and a team built to play through a single creative outlet. Think Juan Román Riquelme (in static mode), classic South American number 10s who demand the ball comes to them rather than chasing it.",
