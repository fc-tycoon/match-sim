## 6. Alternative Match Engines (Detailed)

### 6.1 Philosophy & Encouragement

We **actively encourage** the community to develop alternative match engines for FC Tycoon™. Competition and innovation benefit everyone. Multiple match engine implementations allow:

- Different simulation philosophies (arcade vs. realistic)
- Various performance trade-offs (speed vs. detail)
- Experimental features and approaches
- Community-driven innovation

### 6.2 What Qualifies as an Alternative Engine

An **Alternative Match Engine** is:

- A match simulation system developed **independently** (from scratch)
- Designed to integrate with FC Tycoon™ via defined interfaces
- NOT derived from, copied from, or modified from our source code
- Your own original algorithms, physics, AI, and logic

**Examples of Alternative Engines:**

- A purely physics-based engine using different collision algorithms
- A statistical/probability-based engine
- A machine learning-based tactical simulation
- A simplified arcade-style match engine
- A hyper-realistic biomechanics simulation

### 6.3 What You Can Do with Alternative Engines

**Full Rights:**

- Develop using any language or framework (JavaScript, Rust, WebAssembly, etc.)
- License your engine however you want (MIT, GPL, proprietary, commercial)
- Sell or charge for your alternative engine
- Distribute via GitHub, mod sites, Patreon, or your own website
- Include in your portfolio or use commercially
- Keep 100% of any revenue generated
- Grant or deny others the right to modify your engine

**No License Grant to Us:**

Your alternative engine is **YOUR** work. You do NOT grant us any license. We have no rights to your independent creation.

### 6.4 Requirements for Alternative Engines

**Must NOT:**

- Copy, adapt, or derive from our source code
- Extract our algorithms, formulas, or proprietary techniques
- Include our copyrighted assets without permission
- Claim to be the "official" match engine
- Violate our trademark (don't call it "FC Tycoon Match Engine Official")

**Should:**

- Clearly identify as a community/alternative engine
- Provide your own license terms
- Respect FC Tycoon™ trademarks (okay to say "for FC Tycoon™")
- Follow any integration APIs or interfaces we publish

### 6.5 How to Develop Independently

**Permitted Research:**

- Reading our code to understand the *interface* and *integration points*
- Understanding what data structures the game expects
- Learning how match events are communicated
- Studying the UI/UX to ensure compatibility

**Must Be Independent:**

- Write your own algorithms from scratch
- Use your own physics calculations
- Implement your own AI decision-making
- Create your own data structures (even if similar)

**Gray Area:**

If you're unsure whether your engine is independent or derivative:

- Did you write the code yourself, or copy/adapt ours?
- Could you implement it without having seen our code?
- Are you using fundamentally different approaches/algorithms?

**When in doubt, contact us:** <legal@darkwavestudios.com>

### 6.6 Distribution & Community

**Sharing Your Engine:**

- Post on GitHub, GitLab, or your own repository
- Submit to mod sites (ModDB, Nexus Mods, etc.)
- Share on FC Tycoon™ community forums/Discord
- Create a website or Patreon for your engine
- Publish tutorials and documentation

**We Will NOT:**

- Claim ownership of your independent work
- Demand revenue share or royalties
- Require you to submit your code to us
- Restrict your licensing choices

**We May:**

- Link to popular alternative engines from our website
- Provide APIs/interfaces to help integration
- Feature exceptional engines in community spotlights
- Offer technical guidance on integration (optional)

### 6.7 Liability & Support

**Your Responsibility:**

- You are solely responsible for your alternative engine
- You provide (or don't provide) support as you choose
- You bear liability for bugs, issues, or problems
- You manage your own updates and compatibility

**We Are Not Responsible:**

- For bugs or issues in alternative engines
